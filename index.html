        Nisha, Aami English e likhchi karon ki Bangla te likhle sala onek romantic hoye jaabe &#129315; ...
Since I got promoted to class 12 , you have been unknowingly a big part of my past. As a matter of fact you don't even realise how important you have been for me. At first i didn't realise how you truly were , or maybe you were like this in the past... But whatever the case might be ... You have changed and you are the most perfect version of yourself ... And i would like to say this proudly , that when i feel sad , when i feel happy.. the first thing that comes to my mind is " I have to tell Nisha about this ".
I value you more than anything in my life and if there's anything I am afraid of , it's that one day you might find another friend, and stop talking to me ... One day i am going to sit by my computer, hoping you message but you will be busy chatting with some other new friend &#128534; ... You will laugh while chatting you might feel good with him and maybe you will forget me &#128542; . Let's talk about the present.. we are still the same now and we talk regularly and my entire day is wasted if i don't msz you 'good morning' when i get up ... And i can't sleep if i don't text you ' allah hafiz ' &#129394; so the thing is ... I can't live without the texts ...Regardless of how you feel, I want you to know that I value our friendship more than anything. I hope that we can continue to support each other and be there for each other, no matter what. You're an essential part of my life, and I can't imagine it without you.
This is something I had in my mind for quite some days now... And i got it all out ..
<br>Now let's talk about you .. the most generous, genuine and gentle Homo sapiens sapiens , on this cosmos  &#129319; And never stop messaging please &#129402; Please... Understand that having you with me is the most important thing to me ... I can talk about it for years ... And we will talk for years &#128524; just never forget me and i won't ever forget you &#128151; &#129402;</br>
<br>And here is a collection of memories for you &#128524; </br>
